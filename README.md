This project will display current information on any one of over 8,000 stocks tracked by the IEX trading API.

**Getting Started**

To get started, simply look up any stock's trading symbol. The program is flexible enough that you don't need to 
supply it in all-caps. If you're looking for AAPL, TSLA, AMZN, GOOG, or BRK.A, just use the dropdown favorites bar, or on a smaller screen, the gold star in the top right corner to select it from the favoirtes menu. Otherwise, type the symbol in the field on the top and in the middle of the page and either hit enter or click on the submit button. Live data for the stock's price, high, low, change, change %, as well as company name, CEO and logo will display. It will also show a graph for the day's values down to the minute. Hover your mouse over the line on the graph to see the time and value. 

The program will also pull up to 10 of the newest relevant articles found by the IEX API. The titles of the articles will be displayed below the stock info and will be active hyperlinks that will open the article from its source in a new tab.

Any stocks you enter into the search field that are not on the favorites list will create a button in a new bar just under the one that holds the search field. Any stocks that you enter will persist as green buttons on that bar until the page is refreshed or the 'Reset' button is pressed.

**Favorites**

Next to the company name of any stock you search will be a star symbol. It will be a black outline if it is NOT a favorite, and the star will be solid gold if it is. If you click on/touch this star it will either assign this stock as a favorite semi-permenantly, or remove it from the favorites list semi-permenantly. If you would like to reset the favorites list completely, simply press/click on the 'Reset' button. The page will refresh with the original favorites in the dropdown/slide menu.
